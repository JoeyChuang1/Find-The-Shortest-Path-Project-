# Find The Shortest Path Project

This project implements an efficient A* pathfinding algorithm in Python to navigate between any two points on a grid-based map. It leverages heuristic functions to prioritize promising paths, leading to faster route discovery. A video demonstration showcases the functionality.

## üöÄ Features

- **A* Pathfinding Algorithm**: Utilizes the A* algorithm for optimal pathfinding on grid-based maps.
- **Performance Optimization**: Achieved an average performance improvement of 71% through:
  - **Multiprocessing**: Distributes computations across multiple cores to accelerate pathfinding.
  - **Heurispy Library Integration**: Incorporates pre-defined heuristic functions optimized for various scenarios.
- **Pygame Visualization**: Employs Pygame for efficient visualization of the pathfinding process, aiding in debugging and understanding.
